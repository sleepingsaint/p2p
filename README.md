# P2P

peer 2 peer text and video chat application

made with
* React
* Typescript
* Webrtc
* Peer Js

** Please Don't except all minute features. It's just a weekend hobby project for me to learn about WebRTC and Typescript so didn't worried about the detailed features much.

> Video Chat is still under construction

** Any PR's or suggestions will be appreciated
